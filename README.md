Assignment 1: Invoice Calculator

In this assignment, I developed an invoice calculator to demonstrate my understanding of key web scripting concepts from the first three weeks of class. The calculator allows users to input descriptions, quantities, and prices for up to five line items. It dynamically calculates and displays the total for each line item, along with the sub-total, discount, tax, and grand total.

Key functionalities include:

Using function calls to calculate and update values in real-time.
Declaring and using global constants for discount and tax rates (10% discount for orders over $250, 12% tax rate).
Employing ternary statements to conditionally apply a discount.
Using the toFixed(2) method to format values to two decimal places.
Displaying dynamic results in spans and divisions using JavaScript.
The calculator is structured with efficient calculations, including maintaining a running total for the grand total. My code includes clear comments, consistent naming conventions, and proper indenting for readability and maintenance.
